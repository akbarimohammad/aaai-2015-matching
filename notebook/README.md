[`Results.ipynb`](Results.ipynb) is an iPython notebook to reproduce several figures and tables from the paper. It downloads Twitter mood classifications and performs a statistical analysis to determine how expressions of mood differ by different groups.

The notebook can either be downloaded and run locally, or a static version can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tapilab/aaai-2015-matching/blob/master/notebook/Results.ipynb).
